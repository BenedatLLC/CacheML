DVL: Dataset Virtualization Layer
=================================

This is a proof of concept for a dataset virtualization layer. It abstracts away the source
of a data set and handles both caching and "at rest" encryption.

Performance Test Results
------------------------
There are from running the unit tests which simulate loading the time series data from
datahut.ai, which is in a 216MB compressed csv file. The first case just loads into
a dataframe, while the second case does some additional processing (sorting, removing
entries outside a time range).
